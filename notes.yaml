ideas:
  - "first idea"
    - creating a warp for the entire ui instead of using the body node
    - using display flex grid for its easy to use and reliable fractional functions
  - "alternative"
    - none
  - "second idea"
    - this project has some ui inspiration (after searching google)
    - to prevent to complexity i wont be adding any other features besides one relating to to do list
    - do not include upcoming, today, calendar, tags, settings, sign out
      - include: sticky wall, lists the color coates the "sticky paper"

ideas for Tabs :
  - grab the label text content and then use that to change the Head title of the page 
    - how will you grab the label?
      - created a module that grabs labels from corresponding elements
    - how will you place the text label text content as the Head title
      - we could try implementing a if statement to the radio value
        - if radio value checked assign label return value to header Title
    - how are you going to create the event Listener functionality 
      - possibly create separate module for Initializing event listeners
        - prob gonna call tabs class inside there instead of index.js

ideas for sticky wall: 
  - how do you plan to create a task?
    - user press a button
  - how do you plan to display the form for the user?
    - once the user press the button change the display of the form
      - the form position is probably going to have to be absolute or fixed
    - once form complete append form information to card (all information must be filled) ( might have to include that trick to prevent the default functionality of forms from refreshing the page)
    - where does the data go?
      - i want the form information to be inside a object which gets pushed into in array possibly in descending order (it must be the same order as the cards)
        - this way if another tab is chosen and the function is destroyed the cards 
        the card data will still exist
      - how will the information be passed back into the sticky notes container?
        - create logic for reading the information on the card
        - once read use or create a way to append the information back onto the sticky notes container
    - should there be a limit on how many notes can taken?
      - i think the max amount of notes should be 10 per project

  - what if the user does not file out the form?
    - prevent the card from being created

current bugs: 
  - items besides task for example list cant alter the header title (fixed)
    - reason because the query selector all takes every shared item of that class (fixed)
  - card generates before form is completed 
    - possible fix instead of generating card when card button pressed do it when form is submitted
