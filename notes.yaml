ideas:
  - "first idea"
    - creating a warp for the entire ui instead of using the body node
    - using display flex grid for its easy to use and reliable fractional functions
  - "alternative"
    - none
  - "second idea"
    - this project has some ui inspiration (after searching google)
    - to prevent to complexity i wont be adding any other features besides one relating to to do list
    - do not include upcoming, today, calendar, tags, settings, sign out
      - include: sticky wall, lists the color coates the "sticky paper"

ideas for Tabs :
  - grab the label text content and then use that to change the Head title of the page 
    - how will you grab the label?
      - created a module that grabs labels from corresponding elements
    - how will you place the text label text content as the Head title
      - we could try implementing a if statement to the radio value
        - if radio value checked assign label return value to header Title
    - how are you going to create the event Listener functionality 
      - possibly create separate module for Initializing event listeners
        - prob gonna call tabs class inside there instead of index.js

current bugs: 
  - items besides task for example list cant alter the header title
    - reason because the query selector all takes every shared item of that class
